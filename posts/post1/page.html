Learning a new language
</h1>

<p>
Learning a new language is something programmers have to do in order to keep up with all the cool new things. Many people will say that all programming languages are the same, those people never worked with Prolog or Lisp. Yes, languages like c# and Java are very closely related and it is easy to learn one if you already know the other but because they do some things deferent I will take time to get the hang of things.
</p>

<p>
So because all programming languages are deferent, how on earth do you go about learning them in a fast and easy way? For me, I make a few fun little projects that cover a large part of the language. 
</p>

<p>
Are you learning a new language? If so what projects should you do? I have no idea, it’s up to you. But what I can do is give you some tips:
<ul>
<li>They depend heavily on the language of choice, making a gui in c is not the simplest of tasks. </li>
<li>They need to be short, each one should really not take more than a few hours.</li>
<li>They need to be fun for you to do so no banking software.</li>
<li>You need to be comfortable doing creating them in a language you’re more comfortable working in.</li>
<li>They have to use a lot of the language. This point is probably the most important for example if you are learning java you should do something that deals with polymorphism.</li>
</ul>
</p>

For this blog I had to learn how to use JavaScript, so following my own advice I did a few projects. I really had no idea how JavaScript even worked but I did know that it is really easy to do graphics but that was about it.
