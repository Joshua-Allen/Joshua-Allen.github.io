Making this site
</h1>

I’ve wanted to make a blog for the longest time so because I have a lot of work to do I thought this would be a good time to start one. I think what took me so long to start one was how boing it is to add content. You decide on a clever title, write some stuff, make look nice, press a button and you’re done. So the other day I was thinking that I needed a blog to show off what I’m able to do and it hit me, why not make my own. 
Github was really the best choice to create my blog in because I want people to see the source code and all my other projects code. My only problem was that I had no idea how to create a website. I’m more of a c programmer then a JavaScript one so it never really accord to me that it would be this fun to make. I think it has been so fun because when I started I commented on not looking at any ones else code to see how all the deferent things work so my new favorite website is now w3schools.com.

Because I did absolutely no research in the proper way to do things when it comes to my new blog, I most likely did everything incorrect. So here is what I really want to talk about:

Posts

My goal at the very beginning was to not hard code things. What I wanted was to drop a file into a directory and have everything just work. That ended up being a pain in the ass. I got jquery to get an xml file, that was all well and good but I could not find a way to make a list of sub directories. I spent far too long on how to do this. 
After a lot of trial and error I got it working almost perfectly. What I ended up doing was separating my posts by putting them in a folder with a number index. So a post location is:
“posts/post" + index + "/post.xml"
I said that this almost works because what I’m doing is check if the file exists and if it does add it to an array and recourse with index+1. This causes a 404 error in the debug console and I really don’t like that but there is nothing I can to about it.
