	<h1 class="w3-center">Welcome!</h1> 
	<p>
	My website will be my own little spot where I write about everything that I’m working on. Each one of the posts will most likely seem completely random, badly worded, and short but I can guarantee you that each one will be very interesting to me.

	My main field of interest is real-time user interactive simulations (video games) and because of that I find myself studying almost everything that has to do with a computer and some things that don’t.
