	I feel like I got a late start on this site because I’ve been really busy with all of the really cool things that I always seem to be doing. I’m finding myself going back and looking at all my older projects so I can post about them.  
	</p>
	<p>
	I'm planning for my site to be my own little spot where I write about everything that I’m working on. Each one of the posts will most likely seem completely random, badly worded, and short but I can guarantee you that each one will be very interesting to me.

	My main field of interest is real-time user interactive simulations (video games) and because of that I find myself studying almost everything that has to do with a computer and some things that don’t.
