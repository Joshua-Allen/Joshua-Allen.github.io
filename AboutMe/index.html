	<p>
	My website will be my own little spot where I write about everything that Iâ€™m working on. Each one of the posts will most likely seem completely random, badly worded, and short but I can guarantee you that each one will be very interesting to me.

	It started when I was 11, watching my brother play "Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance" where he walked over some water making ripples. I asked my parents how the game was able to do make the ripples and they replied "it was programmed that way". Curiosity sparked, I began learning about programming.
