	<body>The first thing I do when I start working on the game is to see if Tim (my boss) has the build. To do this we use Trello. I have been really enjoying Trello of how easy it is to manage and review all my current tasks. Before we had Trello we used a document on google drive to show all the current tasks but we had a hard time with who had the build.</body>
