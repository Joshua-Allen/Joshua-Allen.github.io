	<p>
	For homework I was reqierd to make a NFA over the alphabet Σ of ASCII characters, define a Regular Expression that describes a search for the string “coconut” and then convert that into a DFA. So I made a little programe to easly test my DFA.

<div class="w3-content w3-border-bottom">
	<p>
	First, I made a 2d array where each row is a q and the values in the rows represent the characters "Σ, c, o, n, u, t"
	</p>
	<code class="code">
var Q = [];
Q.push([0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]);
Q.push([0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]);
Q.push([0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]);
Q.push([0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]);
Q.push([0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]);
Q.push([0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0]);
Q.push([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7]);
Q.push([7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]);
	</code>

	<p>
	You can probably see how everything works now. q0 is the start, when it sees a 'c' it goes to q1 else it will stay at q0.Do this until until there is no more characters and if it is at q7, “coconut” is in the string else it is not.
