	<h1 class="w3-center">Things that I want to do when I have the time</h1> 
	<p>
	There are a lot of things that I really want to do but they have nothing to do with work or school so they are hard for me to justify spending time on them. This list is ordered from project that I most want to work on to projects that I don’t mind putting off for some time.

	<h3 class="w3-center">Create a new language that compiles to JavaScript with online IDE</h3> 
	<p>
		I have been working with JavaScript a lot and I both really love it and really hate it. The thing I dislike most is it is really hard to work on larger projects because doesn’t really have classes that can be put into separate files. For example, I was working on a little raycast 3d engine and got really annoyed when it came to separating my drawing methods and my math methods. I just really don’t like how I’m support to put them all in an object, that’s just really odd for me.
	</p>
	<p>
		So to combat this what I really want to do is create my own language that is more of a mix between JavaScript and Java. I think having the IDE, which will compile the code into JavaScript, inside the browser would be my best bet for having it work. I really don’t think anyone other than myself would use it but I’m really ok with that because I would use it all the time.

	<h3 class="w3-center">Neural network and speech synthesization</h3> 
	<p>
		I was looking for a lifelike text to speech program but I found myself reading articles on how they work to better understand why lifelike text to speech is so hard to do. While I was reading I came up with an idea of having a neural network train itself using text with me reading the text. A lot of the larger AI companies are using deep learning to identify what is in a picture or speech to text but I was unable to find any of them doing text to speech.

	<h3 class="w3-center">Add algorithms section to site</h3> 
	<p>
		In school I had a class called data structures and it was my absolute favorite because of how much we learned about deferent algorithms. I would like to create a new section on my site where I just implement deferent algorithms. For example, I want to do sorting where you could see them sort. I know you are able to find things like this all over the web but I really want to make each one interactive in some way.

	<h3 class="w3-center">3d renderer</h3> 
	<p>
		Whenever I hit a wall I enjoy making simple renderers. All the renderers that I have ever made have been in 2D and I would really like to try my hand at a 3D one. I know it will be more time consuming then making one in 2D so that’s why I’m putting this here. I have a lot of ideas on how I would go about doing this so this project should be very enlightening.

	<h3 class="w3-center">Physics</h3> 
	<p>
		I would like to try my hand at making my own physics engine. I know it will be hard but I find the topic really interesting. I would start with 2D but I would also like to see if I can even create a 3D physics engine.

	<h3 class="w3-center">Graphing calculator</h3> 
	<p>
		I’ve made a simple calculator before but my Ti-84 is able to do a lot more then basic arithmetic. I also would like to know why it takes so long for it my Ti-84 to actually graph because it is ridiculously slow. I think doing this would give me a really nice refresher on my math.
