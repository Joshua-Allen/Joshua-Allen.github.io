	<h1 class="w3-center">A day working on boss 101</h1> 
	<p>
	The first thing I do when I start working on the game is to see if Tim (my boss) has the build. To do this we use <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>. I have been really enjoying Trello of how easy it is to manage and review all my current tasks. Before we had Trello we used a document on google drive to show all the current tasks but we had a hard time with who had the build. Not really knowing who had the build was a major headache because we where use <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> to store the game file. <b>NEVER DO THIS</b>!!! We switched to a SVN very soon after and that leads me to the next thing I have to do, update the SVN.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	We are using <a href="https://tortoisesvn.net/">TortoiseSVN</a> with <a href="http://www.cloudforge.com/">cloudforge</a> to keep all the game files up to date. Other than a few problems here and there, it makes working on the game super simple. All I need to do is right click the file and press update, that’s it. Once the game is done updating I can open up <a href="https://www.yoyogames.com/">GameMaker Studio</a>, this takes me well over a minute because of how many assets Boss101 has and how gameMaker actually handles the assets but once it’s complete I can finely start working on the game.

<div class="w3-content w3-border-bottom">
	<p>
	Today I want to remake how I handle the environmental objects in the map room. The environmental object handling and creation code is very old so instead of hacking my way around it I’ve decided that it really should just be remade. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Whenever I want to recode some part of the game, the first thing that I do is comment out everything that has to do with that code, if needed I put in some temporary variable, and test the game to see if everything works. I do this because I really don’t want to miss anything. 
	</p>
	<p>
	The only real requirements for this system are: 
	</p>
	<p>
	<ol>
	<li>Tim needs to be able to edit it easily </li>
	<li>Have the ability to be expanded without a rewrite (missed this the first time around)</li>
	</ol>
	</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="w3-content w3-border-bottom">
	<p>
	This first requirement might seem easy but when working with game maker I have to do some weird things that I would take for granted if I were to let’s say be working in java. My own little technique for easy editing comes from the way GameMaker scripts work. 
	</p>
	<code class="code">
///scr_map_add_object(sprite, chance, yMin, yMax, xTimerMin, xTimerMax, yTimerMin, yTimerMax);
/*
sprite      - the sprite that the background object will use
chance      - the precent chance that the object will be created
yMin
yMax        - the object will created in the range of yMin and yMax
xTimerMin 
xTimerMax   - on the creation of the object xtimer will be set with a value in 
	  the range of xTimerMin and xTimerMax
yTimerMin 
yTimerMax   - on the creation of the object ytimer will be set with a value in 
	  the range of yTimerMin and yTimerMax
*/

for (var i=0; i&lt;argument_count; i++) {
obj_info[curIndex,i] = argument[i];
}
curIndex++;
	</code>
	<p>
	This little script populates the second index of the array with the arguments and then increments the index for when the next time the script is called. This technique only works because I know it will be only used within one piece of code in a known location. It is not as fast as just having the code all in one place but one line for each object is much easier to look at then ten. 
	</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="w3-content w3-border-bottom">
	<p>
	Next step is to use that script and populate the info array with all the environment objects that I commented out:
	</p>
	<code class="code">
/// flyby object info

// 2D array of the flyby objects info [index, scr_map_add_object]
obj_info = 0;

// value used in scr_map_add_object
curIndex = 0;

// populate the array
scr_map_add_object(spn_enObj1,       9,  2250,2619,   5, 7,   0, 0);// Bottom Plane 1
scr_map_add_object(spn_enObj2,       9,  2250,2619,   3, 9,   0, 0);// Bottom Plane 2
scr_map_add_object(spr_enObj52_cm,   7,  2250,2619,  30,40,   0, 0);// Cloud 1
scr_map_add_object(spr_enObj54_cm,   6,  2250,2619,  30,40,   0, 0);// Cloud 2
scr_map_add_object(spr_enObj51_cm,   5,  2250,2619,  30,40,   0, 0);// Cloud 3
scr_map_add_object(spn_enObj8,      10,  1635,2336,   5, 7,  20,40);// Satellite 1
scr_map_add_object(spn_enObj9,       9,  1635,2336,   3, 9,  20,40);// Satellite 2
scr_map_add_object(spn_enObj7,      10,  1154,2047,   3, 9,  20,40);// Satellite 3
scr_map_add_object(spn_enObj9,      11,  1154,2047,   4,10,  20,40);// Spaceship 1
scr_map_add_object(spr_enObj20,     12,   674,1765,   4, 9,  20,40);// Asteroid 1
scr_map_add_object(spr_enObj23,     11,   674,1765,   2, 9,  20,40);// Asteroid 2
scr_map_add_object(spr_enObj29,     11,   674,1765,   4, 7,  20,40);// Asteroid 3
scr_map_add_object(spr_enObj22,     12,   674,1765,   4, 9,  20,40);// Asteroid 4
	</code>
	<p>
	That 22 line segment of code is replacing 69 lines that was in the old code, that’s a win in my book. So all I have to do now is fill the room up with those objects and then keep it filled when they go off the screen.

<div class="w3-content w3-border-bottom">
	<p>
	GameMaker does not allow for a true object constructer so once again I must use a little technique that allows for me to send a lot of data with the creation of the environment objects. This technique requires a known object that is already created and an array or other data stricter within it. Because of GameMaker’s object creation code “instance_create(x, y, obj )“ I can send two doubles to the object before it runs the creation code, so in that bit of cade I can do something like:
	</p>
	<code class="code">
// the index of the array to look at
info_index = y;

// get the info
sprite_index = info_array[info_index,0];
y = irandom_range(info_array[info_index,2], info_array[info_index,3]);
xTime_max = irandom_range(info_array[info_index,4], info_array[info_index,5]);
yTime_max = irandom_range(info_array[info_index,6], info_array[info_index,7]);
	</code>
	<p>
	So when creating a new environmental object I must remember to set the y to the index of the array. There are better ways of going about this, like having a global data structure for passing variables like this.
