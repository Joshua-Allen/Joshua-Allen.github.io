<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>This blog will be my own little spot where I write about everything that I’m working on. Each one of the posts will most likely seem completely random, badly worded, and short but I can guarantee you that each one will be very interesting to me.</p>
<p>My main field of interest is real-time user interactive simulations (video games) and because of that I find myself studying almost everything that has to do with a computer and some things that don’t.</p>
